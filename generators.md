Generating Function
  represent a sequence of numbers as an algebraic function in which each term in the sequence is a coefficient
  of an $`x^{j}`$ term in the function  
  Example:  
    the sequence  
        $`f_{0},f_{1},f_{2},...`$   
    is represented by the generating function  
        $`F(x) = f_{0} + f_{1}x + f_{2}x^2 + f_{3}x^3`$  
    $`f_{j}`$ is the coefficient of the $`x^j`$ term
