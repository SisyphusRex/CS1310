Integers
    Even x = 2k
    Odd x = 2k + 1
Rational
    r: r=x/y, y!=0
Divides
    x divides y: x|y
    iff x!=0 & y = kx
    x does not divide y: x∤y
Prime
    n is prime iff n>1 and the only positive integers x|n are 1, n
Composite
    n is composite iff n>1 and 1<m<n and m|n
Positive
    x>0
Negative
    x<0
Noneggative
    x>=0
Nonpositive
    x<=0
Absolute Value
    |x| = -x if x<0
    |x| = x if x>=0

Thus, therefore:
    it follows that, then, hence
Let:
    introduce new variable names
Suppose:
    introduce new variable or assumption
Since:
    statement depends on earlier fact
    because we know that
We will prove, we will show:
    indicate where proof is going
By definition:
    fact known because of assumption
In other words:
    rephrasing a statement
Gives, yields:
    an equation follows from another

Types of Proofs:
    Vacuous
        conclusion doesnt matter
    Trivial
        premise doesnt matter
    Contradiction
        p → q is true by showing ¬(p → q) is true and ¬r∧r
        ¬(p → q) → ¬r∧r
    Direct
        prove theory from statements
    Contrapositive
        p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p
