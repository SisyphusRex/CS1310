xRy
  x is related to y based on relation R

Rsubz on Z
  Relation of Z on Z
  x and y must be elements of Z

Reflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∈ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, xRx thus (x,x) ∈ R
  OR
  ∀x, xRx

Anti-Reflexive or Irreflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∉ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, (x,x) ∉ R

Symmetric
  For all x and for all y, (x,y) and (y,x) ∈ R
  OR
  For every pair x,y ∈ A, xRy ⟺ yRx
  OR
  ∀x∀y, xRy ⟺ yRx

Antisymmetric
  To prove simply:
    if (a,b) and (b,a) ∈ R, then a=b to be antisymmetric
  OR A relation is anti-symmetric if for every pair of distinct elements (x and y), one of the following holds:
    1. (x,y) ∈ R, but (y,x) ∉ R
    2. (y,x) ∈ R, but (x,y) ∉ R
    3. (x,y) ∉ R and (y,x) ∉ R

Transitive
  ((x,y) ∈ R) ∧ ((y,z) ∈ R) → ((x,z) ∈ R)
  ** x,y,z do not have to be distinct
  

Equivalence
  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

Partial Order
  poset or pos(S,R)
  reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive

Relatively Prime
  a and b are relatively prime if the only positive integer to evenly divide both is 1

Digraph
  directed graph
  consists of (V, E) where 
    V is set of vertices or elements of V
    E is set of directed edges
      (u,v) ∈ E
      u is tail
      v is head
      if u=v, selfloop
  in-degree
    number of edges pointing into a vertex
  out-degree
    number of edges pointing out of it

Walk
  ⟨v0, v1, ..., vl⟩
  sequence of vertices and edges, but can be represented by vertices
  ⟨a,b,*,c⟩ third vertex is unknown
The sequence of vertices is a walk only if:
  (vi-1,vi) ∈ E for each i = 1,2,...,l
Length of walk, l
  number of edges in walk
Open Walk
  first and last vertices are not the same
Closed Walk
  First and last vertices are the same
Trail
  walk in which no edge occurs more than once
Path
  open walk in which no vertex occurs more than once
Circuit
  closed trail
Cycle
  circuit of length at least 1 in which no vertex occurs more than once, except the first and       last vertex, which are the same

Composition
  of relations R and S on set A is another relation on set A
    denoted S ∘ R
    R is applied first, then S
    if (a,b) ∈ R and then (b,c) ∈ S, then (a,c) ∈ S ∘ R
  OR
    there exists x ∈ A such that (b,x) ∈ R and (x,c) ∈ S

Graph Power Theorem
  G is a directed graph
  u and v are any two vertices in G
  there is an edge from u to v in G^k
    iff there is a walk of length k from u to v in G
