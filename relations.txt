xRy
  x is related to y based on relation R

Rsubz on Z
  Relation of Z on Z
  x and y must be elements of Z

Reflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∈ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, xRx thus (x,x) ∈ R

Anti-Reflexive or Irreflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∉ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, (x,x) ∉ R

Symmetric
  For all x and for all y, (x,y) and (y,x) ∈ R
  OR
  For every pair x,y ∈ A, xRy ⟺ yRx

Antisymmetric
  To prove simply:
    if (a,b) and (b,a) ∈ R, then a=b to be antisymmetric
  OR A relation is anti-symmetric if for every pair of distinct elements (x and y), one of the following holds:
    1. (x,y) ∈ R, but (y,x) ∉ R
    2. (y,x) ∈ R, but (x,y) ∉ R
    3. (x,y) ∉ R and (y,x) ∉ R

Transitive
  ((x,y) ∈ R) ∧ ((y,z) ∈ R) → ((x,z) ∈ R)
  ** x,y,z do not have to be distinct
  

Equivalence
  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

Partial Order
  poset or pos(S,R)
  reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive

Relatively Prime
  a and b are relatively prime if the only positive integer to evenly divide both is 1
