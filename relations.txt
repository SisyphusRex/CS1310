xRy
  x is related to y based on relation R

Rsubz on Z
  Relation of Z on Z
  x and y must be elements of Z

Reflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∈ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, xRx thus (x,x) ∈ R
  OR
  ∀x, xRx

Anti-Reflexive or Irreflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∉ R
  OR
  For every x ∈ A, (x,x) ∉ R

Symmetric
  For all x and for all y, (x,y) and (y,x) ∈ R
  OR
  For every pair x,y ∈ A, xRy ⟺ yRx
  OR
  ∀x∀y, xRy ⟺ yRx

Antisymmetric
  To prove simply:
    if (a,b) and (b,a) ∈ R, then a=b to be antisymmetric
  OR A relation is anti-symmetric if for every pair of distinct elements (x and y), one of the following holds:
    1. (x,y) ∈ R, but (y,x) ∉ R
    2. (y,x) ∈ R, but (x,y) ∉ R
    3. (x,y) ∉ R and (y,x) ∉ R

Transitive
  ((x,y) ∈ R) ∧ ((y,z) ∈ R) → ((x,z) ∈ R)
  ** x,y,z do not have to be distinct
  

Equivalence
  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

Partial Order
  poset or pos(S,R)
  reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive
  aRb or a⪯b
    a is at most b
  Domain (A,⪯)
  Comparable:
    if x⪯y or y⪯x
    otherwise, incomparable
    must be relation between two vertices (arrow/edge)
  Total Order:
    if every two elements in domain are comparable
  Minimal Element:
    no edges into vertex except from that vertex (reflexive)
    x is minimal if no y such that y<x
  Maximal Element:
    no edges leaving vertex except end at that vertex 
    x is maximal if no y such that x<y
Natural Partial Order:
  consider set A
  there is a natural partial order on P(A) power set of A
  for any two subsets X and Y of A:
    X ⪯ Y if X ⊆ Y

Strict Order
  < operator
  transitive and anti-reflexive
  similar to partial order, except NO SELF-LOOPS

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
  directed graph with no cycles
    cycle: circuit of length at least 1 in which no vertex occurs more than once, except the first and last vertex
  Example: prerequisite courses cannot have any cycles, else one could never get in course

DAG Strict order:
  Let G be a directed graph.  G has no cycles iff G+ is a strict order

Topological Sort
  order vertices consistent with edges of graph
  if (u,v), then u must appear earlier than v
  

Relatively Prime
  a and b are relatively prime if the only positive integer to evenly divide both is 1

Sets
    R A N G E
  D
  O
  M
  A
  I
  N
    If D = {1,2,3} and R= {3,4} x<y
    3 4

  3 0 1

Digraph
  directed graph
  consists of (V, E) where 
    V is set of vertices or elements of V
    E is set of directed edges
      (u,v) ∈ E
      u is tail
      v is head
      if u=v, selfloop
  in-degree
    number of edges pointing into a vertex
  out-degree
    number of edges pointing out of it

Walk
  ⟨v0, v1, ..., vl⟩
  sequence of vertices and edges, but can be represented by vertices
  ⟨a,b,*,c⟩ third vertex is unknown
The sequence of vertices is a walk only if:
  (vi-1,vi) ∈ E for each i = 1,2,...,l
Length of walk, l
  number of edges in walk
Open Walk
  first and last vertices are not the same
Closed Walk
  First and last vertices are the same
Trail
  walk in which no edge occurs more than once
Path
  open walk in which no vertex occurs more than once
Circuit
  closed trail
Cycle
  circuit of length at least 1 in which no vertex occurs more than once, except the first and       last vertex, which are the same

Composition
  of relations R and S on set A is another relation on set A
    denoted S ∘ R
    R is applied first, then S
    if (a,b) ∈ R and then (b,c) ∈ S, then (a,c) ∈ S ∘ R
  OR
    there exists x ∈ A such that (b,x) ∈ R and (x,c) ∈ S

Graph Power Theorem
  G is a directed graph
  u and v are any two vertices in G
  there is an edge from u to v in G^k
    iff there is a walk of length k from u to v in G

Transitive Closure
  R+
  smallest relation that is both transitive and includes all the pairs from R

Matrix Multiplication
  n x m matrix with n rows and m columns
  n x m matrix over S includes elements of S

Adjacency Matrix
  a directed graph G with n vertices can be represented by n x n matrix over the set {0,1}
    this is the Adjacency Matrix of G
  A_{i,j} =  1 if there is an edge from vertex i to j; if no edge, = 0

If mathematical operations are defined on set S, then matrix operations can be defined for matrices
  over set S

Boolean Matrix
  matrix with entries from set {0,1}

Matrix Multiplication defined:
  A x B is defined only if columns in A = rows in B
  each entry in A x B is computed by taking the dot product of a row of A and a column of B
  If A and B are n x n matrices, the dot product of row i in A and column j in B is the sum of the product  
    of each entry in row i from A with the corresponding entry in column j from B:
    A(i,1)B(1,j) + A(i,2)B(2,j)+...+A(i,n)B(n,j)

Matrix Product
  AB
  take dot product of each row and column combination and plot in new matrix

Matrix Multiplication Properties:
  associative: A(BC) = (AB)C
  not commutative: AB ≠ BA

Matrix Addition
  A + B is well defined if both matrices are m x n size
  (A+B)(i,j) = A(i,j) + B(i,j) for all i to m and all j to n

Matrix Addition and Union
  G adjacency A
  H adjacency B
  G ∪ H = A + B
