xRy
  x is related to y based on relation R

Rsubz on Z
  Relation of Z on Z
  x and y must be elements of Z

Reflexive
  For all x=y, (x,y) ∈ R

Anti-Reflexive or Irreflexive
  Fora all x=y, (x,y) ∉ R

Symmetric
  (x,y) and (y,x) ∈ R

Antisymmetric
  if (a,b) and (b,a) ∈ R, then a=b

Transitive
  ((x,y) ∈ R) ∧ ((y,z) ∈ R) → ((x,z) ∈ R)
  ** Any relation with a domain cardinality of 2 is automatically transitive**

Equivalence
  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

Partial Order
  poset or pos(S,R)
  reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive

Relatively Prime
  a and b are relatively prime if the only positive integer to evenly divide both is 1
