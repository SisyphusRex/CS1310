Graphs
Specifically, unDirected Graphs:
 the edges are UNORDERED pairs of vertices
Parallel Edges
 multiple edges between same pair of vertices
Simple Graph
 no parallel edges or self-loops
Edge Set V
 {{a,b}, {...,...},...}
 whereas directed graph contains tuples {(a,b)...}

Incident
 edge that is associated with vertices v and w
 For Digraphs
  incident edges are only in-degree edges
Adjacent
 vertices that share an edge

Degree
    number of neighbors a vertex has

Total degree
    sum of degrees of all vertices
    2 * number of edges
Regular Graph
    all vertices have the same degree
d-Regular Graph
    all vertices have degree d

Complete Graph K_n
    edge between every pair of vertices
    AKA clique
Cycle C_n
    edges form a ring
Hypercube Q_n
    2^n vertices
K_(n,m)
    vertices in two sets, n and m
    no edges in same sets
    every vertex in one set has edge to every vertex of other set

Adjacency List Representation
    Each vertex has list of neighbors in table
Matrix Representation
    Vertices on both axes
    1 indicates edge, 0 no edge

Isomorphic
    correspondence between the vertex sets of each graph such that:
        there is an edge between two vertices of one graph iff
        ther is an edge between corresponding vertices of second graph
Degree Sequence
    list of degrees of all vertices in decreasing order
