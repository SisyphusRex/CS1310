Formulae
 n- vertices, m- edges, r-regions
 Total Degree = 2 * m
 Total Degree = n(n-1)
 Total Edges = n(n-1)/2
 Euler Identity: n - m + r = 2
 Edges in Planar Graph n>=3, m <= 3n - 6
  if m > 3n -6, then graph is not planar

Graphs
Specifically, unDirected Graphs:
 the edges are UNORDERED pairs of vertices
Parallel Edges
 multiple edges between same pair of vertices
Simple Graph
 no parallel edges or self-loops
Complete Graph
 simple graph with exactly one edge between each pair of vertices
Edge Set V
 {{a,b}, {...,...},...}
 whereas directed graph contains tuples {(a,b)...}

Incident
 edge that is associated with vertices v and w
 For Digraphs
  incident edges are only in-degree edges
Adjacent
 vertices that share an edge

Degree
    number of neighbors a vertex has

Total degree
    sum of degrees of all vertices
    2 * number of edges
Regular Graph
    all vertices have the same degree
d-Regular Graph
    all vertices have degree d

Complete Graph K_n
    edge between every pair of vertices
 total degree = n(n-1)
 total edges = n(n-1)/2
 degree of vertex = n - 1
Cycle C_n
    edges form a ring
Wheel
 W_n
 add single vertex to C_n and connecting it to each other vertex
Hypercube Q_n
    2^n vertices
    vertices: 1,2,4,8,16,...2^n
K_(n,m)
    vertices in two sets, n and m
    no edges in same sets
    every vertex in one set has edge to every vertex of other set

Adjacency List Representation
    Each vertex has list of neighbors in table
Matrix Representation
    Vertices on both axes
    1 indicates edge, 0 no edge

Isomorphic
    correspondence between the vertex sets of each graph such that:
        there is an edge between two vertices of one graph iff
        ther is an edge between corresponding vertices of second graph
Degree Sequence
    list of degrees of all vertices in decreasing order

Walks, etc.
    SEE Digraphs in relations.txt
Walk:
    starts at vertex and ends at vertex, series of alternating vertexes and edges
    length= number of edges
    Closed: ends at same vertex
    Open: not at same vertex
Trail:
    walk with no repeated edges
Path:
    open walk with no repeated vertexes
Circuit:
    closed Trail
Cycle:
    circuit of length at least 1 which no vertex occurs more than once (except start and end)

Connected Vertices
    walk between u and v
    if every pair connected, graph is connected, otherwise disconnected
Isolated vertex:
    not connected with any other vertices
Connected Component:
    if another vertex is added to set, then it will be disconnected

k-Vertex-Connected
    contains at least k+1 vertices and remains connected after any k-1 vertices removed from graph
Vertex Connectivity
    largest k such that the graph is k-vertex-connected
    κ(G)
    OR
    minimum number of vertices which would disconnect the graph

k-Edge-Connected
    removing k-1 or fewer edges results in connected graph
Edge Connectivity:
    largest k such that the graph is k-edge-connected
    λ(G)
    OR
    minimum number of edges that would disconnect the graph

Euler Circuit:
    contains every edge and every vertex
    every vertex has even degree
    IF G is connected and every vertex is even degree
        THEN Euler circuit exists
Euler Trail:
 open trail that includes every edge and vertex
 must be a connected graph and exactly 2 vertices with odd degree
 must begin on odd degree vertex

Hamilton Cycle:
 cycle that includes every vertex in an undirected graph
 if graph contains vertex of degree 1, cannot be hamilton cycle
Hamilton Path:
 path that includes every vertex in an undirected graph
** Turn Cycle into path by deleting last vertex
thus, every hamilton cycle contains a hamilton path

Embedding
 for G=(V,E) is an assignment of the vertices to points in the plane and the assignment of each edge to a continuous curve
   the curve for each edge must start and end at the two points corresponding to the endpoints of the edge
Planar Embedding
 none of the edges cross
Crossing
 between two edges
 if their curves intersect at a point that is not a common endpoint
Planar Graph
 if the graph has planar embedding
Complement of an Embedding
 set of all points in the plane that are not a vertex or part of a curve
Region
 set of points in embedding that form a maximal continuous set
Maximal
 another point cannot be added to region and it remains continuous
Continuous
 One cannot travel from one part to another without crossing an edge
Euler's Planar Identity
 Consider a planar embedding of a connected graph G.  
 n is number of vertices in G
 m is number of edges
 r is number of regions in the embedding
 n - m + r = 2
Degree of Region
 number of times one traverses the edges of the region
 internal pointing regions can be traversed twice
Number of Edges on Planar Graph
 n vertices
 m edges
 if n >= 3, then m <= 3n-6

Graph Coloring
 each edge must connect vertices of different colors
 Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph and C a finite set of colors.  
 Valid Coloring:
  is a function f: V → C such that for every edge {x,y} ∈ E, f(x) ≠ f(y)
 k-Coloring of G
  if the size of the range of functionf is k, then f is called a k-coloring of G
Chromatic Number
 χ(G) is the smallest k such that ther is a valid k-coloring of G
 check for valid colorings until you cannot go smaller

Clique
 Subset of vertices of G such that all unique vertices are adjacent
 subgraph must be K complete
Clique Number
 maximum number of vertices that are subgraph of G and K complete
 ω(G) number of vertices in a maximum clique of G (no clique with more vertices)
  ω(G) <= χ(G)
