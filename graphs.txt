Graphs
Specifically, unDirected Graphs:  
 the edges are UNORDERED pairs of vertices
Parallel Edges
 multiple edges between same pair of vertices
Simple Graph
 no parallel edges or self-loops
Edge Set V
 {{a,b}, {...,...},...}
 whereas directed graph contains tuples {(a,b)...}

Incident
 edge that is associated with vertices v and w
 For Digraphs
  incident edges are only in-degree edges
Adjacent
 vertices that share an edge
