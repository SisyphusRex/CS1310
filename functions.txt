Target :
    y, possible results domain

Range
    actual results of f(x)
    codomain

Well Defined
    every element of x has a y
    and only one y

Function equality:
    f(x) = g(x) if they have same domain and target (range doesnt matter)

Injective:
    one to one
    each element of x maps to a different element of target

Surjective:
    onto
    range of f(x) equals target Y
    every element of Y has an x

Bijective
    one to one and onto

Inverse
    f(x) = (x,y)
    f^-1 = (y,x)
    only if all elements of Y map to an x
    f(x) must be bijection

    Solve equation for x by replacing f(x) with Y
        f(x) = -x + 3
        y = -x + 3
        x = -y + 3 (inverse)

Composition of Functions
    f ∘ g = f(g(x))

Identity Function
    Identity of A is IsubA: A → A
    IsubA(a) = a

Composed Inverse
    if f(a) = b has an inverse
    then f^-1(b) = a

Exponential
    Zero Exponent Law: a^0 = 1.
    Identity Exponent Law: a^1 = a.
    Product Law: a^m × a^n = a^ m+n
    Quotient Law: a^m/a^n = a^ m-n
    Negative Exponents Law: a^-m = 1/a^ m
    Power of a Power: (a^m)^n = a^mn
    Power of a Product: (ab)^m = a^mb^m
    Power of a Quotient: (a/b)m = a^m/b^m
    a^(x + y) = b^xb^y

Logarithms
    Product Rule:
        log2(4*8) = log2(4) + log2(8)
    Quotient Rule:
        log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y)
    Power Rule:
        logb(m^n) = nlogb(m)
    Change of Base:
        logc(x) = (logb(x)/logb(c)) where c !=1

Strictly Increasing
    x1 < x2 and f(x1) < f(x2)

Strictly Decreasing
    x1 < x2 and f(x1) > f(x2)

Composition
    (g∘f)x = g(f(x))
