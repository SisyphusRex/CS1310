Finite State Machine
  FSM
  Finite State Automaton
  consist of a finite set of states with transitions between the states triggered by different input actions
  machine at rest in state: input could change state or not depending on input handling
  current state is the only state a machine remembers
  states Q {Locked, Unlocked}
  designated start state: Locked
    q_0 is start state
  actions I {Coin, Push}
    input is a sequence of actions from I

Transition Function δ (Delta)
  reaction of a FSM to input
  input to Transition Function is current state and input action:
    Q x I cartesian product set
  δ(Locked, Coin) = Unlocked
  δ: Q x I → Q
