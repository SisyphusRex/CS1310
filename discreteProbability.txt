Bayes Theorem
  P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B)

Experiment:
  procedure that results in one out of a number of possible outcomes
Sample Space:
  Set of all possible outcomes
Event:
  Subset of the sample space
Outcome
    possible happening or occurrence

Discrete Probability
    sample space is finite or countably infinite set
    probability mass functions
Countably Infinite:
    if there is a one-to-one (injective) correspondence between the elements of the set and the integers
    Examples:
      binary strings, rational numbers, ordered pairs of integers
Uncountably Infinite
    set of Real numbers (infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1)
    continuous probability
    get number within a range
      probability density functions
