Integer Division
  Input and output values must always be integers
  Dividend, divisor, quotient and remainder are all integers
Division Algorithm
  x|y , x divides y
  iff x≠0 and there is an integer k such that y = kx
  x∤y , x does not divide y
  If x|y, then y is a multiple of x, and x is factor of y

Linear Combination
  the sum of multiples of two numbers
  Example:
    3x + 7y
  Generic:
    sx + ty

Divisibility of Linear Combinations
  if x|y and x|z then x|(sy + tz)

Division Algorithm
  q: quotient 
  r: remainder
  d: divisor
  n: dividend
  n is an integer and d is positive integer
    then there are unique integers q and r with 0 ≤ r ≤ d-1 
    such that n = qd + r
  q = n div d
  r = n mod d
  
Modular Arithmetic
  Addition
    (x + y) mod m
  Multiplication
    (x * y) mod m

Ring
  set {0, 1, 2, ... , m-1}
  iff addition and multiplication are defined
  ℤₘ is ring symbol

Hash Function
  maps data items into array called hash table
  Hash Table should be larger than input data set
  h(n) = cn mod T
    n is input key
    c is a constant
    T is size of hash table
  ** NOTE: T and c should be coprime to reduce collisions
