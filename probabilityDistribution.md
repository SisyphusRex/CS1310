A probability distribution over the outcomes of an experiment with a countable sample space S is a function p from S to the set
of real numbers in the interval from 0 to 1 with the property that:  
$`\sum_{s∈S}^{}p(s)=1`$  
The probability of outcome s is p(s).  If E ⊆ S is an event, then the probability of event E is:
$`p(E)=\sum_{s∈E}^{}p(s)`$
