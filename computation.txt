Big O Notation (UPPER BOUND)
  Let 𝑓 and 𝑔 be functions from ℤ+ to ℝ≥
    ℝ≥ denotes the set of nonnegative real numbers: ℝ≥ = ℝ+ ∪ {0}
  Then 𝑓 is O(𝑔) if there are positive real numbers 𝑐 and 𝑛₀ such that for any 𝑛 ∈ ℤ+ where 𝑛 ≥ 𝑛₀,
    𝑓(𝑛) ≤ 𝑐 * 𝑔(𝑛)
    𝑛₀ need not be zero; we can omit small values of n if 𝑓(𝑛) < 𝑔(𝑛) and n < 𝑛₀

Omega Notation Ω (LOWER BOUND)
  Let 𝑓 and 𝑔 be functions from ℤ+ to ℝ≥
  Then 𝑓 is Ω(𝑔) if there are positive real numbers 𝑐 and 𝑛₀ such that for any 𝑛 ∈ ℤ+ where 𝑛 ≥ 𝑛₀,
    𝑓(𝑛) ≥ 𝑐 * 𝑔(𝑛)

𝑓 is Ω(𝑔) iff 𝑔 is O(𝑓)

Theta Notation Θ (SAME RATE)
  Let 𝑓 and 𝑔 be functions from ℤ+ to ℝ≥
  Then 𝑓 is Θ(𝑔) if 𝑓 is O(𝑔) and 𝑓 is Ω(𝑔)

Asymptotic Growth of Polynomials
  let 𝑝(𝑛) be a degree-𝑘 polynomial of the form:
  𝑝(𝑛) = 𝑎ₖ𝑛^𝑘 + 𝑎_(𝑘-1)𝑛^(𝑘-1)+ ... + 𝑎₁𝑛 + 𝑎₀
  in which 𝑎ₖ > 0.
  Then 𝑝(𝑛) is Θ(𝑛^𝑘)
