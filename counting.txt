Σ
  set of characters
  alphabet
Σⁿ 
  set of strings of length n containing characters from Σ

Product Rule
  count sequences
  Example:
    Main course = {a, b, c]
    drink = {x, y}
    desert = {m, n}
    Total combinations:
      3 * 2 * 2 = 12

Sum Rule
  multiple choices available, only one selection made
  Example:
    Computer components
    screen size = {a, b, c}
    processor speed = {x, y}
    Storage
      HDD = {m, n, o}
        OR
      SDD = {q, r}
    Total = 
      3 * 2 * (3 + 2) = 30

Bijection mapping power set to string:
  X = {1, 2, 3, 4} 
  f defined from P(x) to {0,1}^4
  f({1,4}) = 1001 because 1 and 4 are first and last in set
  f^-1(1101) = {1,2,4} because 3 is third element and is absent
  
k-to-1 Rule
  count number of elements in the range by counting number of elements in domain and dividing by k
  must be exactly k different x such that f(x) = y
  Example:
    pile of shoes on floor, 24 in total, cardinality of x = 24
    each pair belongs to one person, k = 2
    cardinality of y = 24 / 2 = 12
