Pigeonhole Principle
  If n pigeons are in k holes, and k < n, then some hole has more than one pigeon
  If n pigeons fly into k holes and k<n, then some pigeonhole contains at least ⌈n/k⌉ pigeons


Exclusion Principle:
  |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

Exclusion Three Sets:
  |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |B ∩ C| - |A ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

General Exclusion principle:
  ** Look up sigma notation on web
  1. Add size of (cardinality) of each set
    |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|...
  2. Subtract pairwise intersections
    - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - ...
  3. Add three way intersecions
    + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + ...
  4. Subtract four way intersecion
    - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|



PERMUTATION:
  order matters; distinct
COMBINATION:
  order doesnt matter

Σ
  set of characters
  alphabet
Σⁿ 
  set of strings of length n containing characters from Σ

Product Rule
  count sequences
  Example:
    Main course = {a, b, c]
    drink = {x, y}
    desert = {m, n}
    Total combinations:
      3 * 2 * 2 = 12

Sum Rule
  multiple choices available, only one selection made
  Example:
    Computer components
    screen size = {a, b, c}
    processor speed = {x, y}
    Storage
      HDD = {m, n, o}
        OR
      SDD = {q, r}
    Total = 
      3 * 2 * (3 + 2) = 30

Bijection mapping power set to string:
  X = {1, 2, 3, 4} 
  f defined from P(x) to {0,1}^4
  f({1,4}) = 1001 because 1 and 4 are first and last in set
  f^-1(1101) = {1,2,4} because 3 is third element and is absent
  
k-to-1 Rule
  count number of elements in the range by counting number of elements in domain and dividing by k
  must be exactly k different x such that f(x) = y
  Example:
    pile of shoes on floor, 24 in total, cardinality of x = 24
    each pair belongs to one person, k = 2
    cardinality of y = 24 / 2 = 12

Generalized Product Rule
  number of items in a set is the product of number of choices in each step
  Runners Top 3:
    20 runners
    20 * 19 * 18
    because each step removes one runner

Generalize Product Rule: Counting Permutations
  Permutations are sequences: ORDER MATTERS 
    use parentheses ()
  r-permutation:
    sequence of r items with no repetitions
  Number of permutations in set with n elements:
    n!
    P(n,n)
  Number of permutations of length x in n elements
    P(n,x)

Permutations with Product Rule:
  wedding photo with 6 people, bride and groom next to eachother
  5 total items (4 individuals, 1 group)
  group has 2 arrangements
  5! * 2 = 240

Subsets:
  Subsets are combinations: order does not matter, uniqueness does
    use {} braces

Factorials:
  P(5,3) = 5!/2! = (5 * 4 * 3) / (2 * 1)

Count Subsets k- to - 1 rule:
  Example:
    How many subsets of 3 colors from 5 color set
    Number of permutations = P(5,3) = 5!/2!
    since subset is of length 3, number of k = 3!
    5!/2! / 3! = 10
    Number of r subsets from S with n elements =
      P(n,r)/r!

n choose r notation
  (ⁿᵣ) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
  nCr
  C(n,r)
n Permute notation
  nPr
  P(n,r)

Permutations with repetition:
  how many ways to scramble mississippi
    2 P
    4 S
    4 I
    1 M
    11 total spaces
    11C2 * 9C4 * 5C4 * 1C1
  reduce n by number of repetitions of each char

Multiset
  Number of occurrences of each element matters
  {1, 2, 2, 3} != {1, 2, 3} if multiset

Encoding:
  number of bits = n + m - 1
  where n is number of items selected
  m is number of varieties

Turn into binary string:
  5 blue balls, 2 red balls, 3 green balls
  00000 1 00 1 000
  5 zeros, 1, 2 zeros, 1, three zeros

Counting multisets:
  number of ways to select n objects from set of m varieties:
    C(n+m-1 , m-1)
  EXAMPLE:
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 12
    n = 12
    m = 4
    C(15,3)

Balls in Bins
  Count Number OF Ways to put balls in bins
  n balls
  m bins
  (possible restrictions on number of balls)
  Indistinguishable Balls No Restrictions
    C(n+m-1, m-1)
  Indistinguishable balls At Most One Ball per Bin
    C(m, n)
  Indistiguishable balls with same number per bin
    1
  Distinguishable No Restriction
    m^n
  Distinguishable At Most One per bin
    P(m,n)
  Distinguishable same number per bin
    n!/((n/m)!)^m
