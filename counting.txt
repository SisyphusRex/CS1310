Σ
  set of characters
  alphabet
Σⁿ 
  set of strings of length n containing characters from Σ

Product Rule
  count sequences
  Example:
    Main course = {a, b, c]
    drink = {x, y}
    desert = {m, n}
    Total combinations:
      3 * 2 * 2 = 12

Sum Rule
  multiple choices available, only one selection made
  Example:
    Computer components
    screen size = {a, b, c}
    processor speed = {x, y}
    Storage
      HDD = {m, n, o}
        OR
      SDD = {q, r}
    Total = 
      3 * 2 * (3 + 2) = 30
