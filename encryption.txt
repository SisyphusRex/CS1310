Alice is sender
Bob is receiver
Eve is eavesdropper
m is plaintext
c is ciphertext
k is secret key
M is set of all possible plaintexts
C is set of all possible ciphertexts

Consider cryptosystem in which set of possible plaintexts is Z_N for some integer N.
Alice and Bob share a secret number k ∈ Z_N
To encrypt plaintext m ∈ Z_N:
c = (m + k) mod N
Decryption (inverse):
m = (c - k) mod N

Symmetric Key Cryptosystem
  Alice and Bob share same key, and must meet in advance to share the key.

Requirements:
  One-to-one encryption
    if m≠m' and m,m' ∈ Z_N, then (m+k)mod N ≠ (m' + k) mod N
  Decryption is inverse of encryption
    if m ∈ Z_N then (((m+k)mod N) - k) mod N = m
