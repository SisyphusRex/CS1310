Alice is sender
Bob is receiver
Eve is eavesdropper
m is plaintext
c is ciphertext
k is secret key
M is set of all possible plaintexts
C is set of all possible ciphertexts

Consider cryptosystem in which set of possible plaintexts is Z_N for some integer N.
Alice and Bob share a secret number k ∈ Z_N
To encrypt plaintext m ∈ Z_N:
c = (m + k) mod N
Decryption (inverse):
m = (c - k) mod N
